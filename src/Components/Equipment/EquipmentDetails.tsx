            <p>Good hiking boots are the foundation of any hike. They provide the support, traction, and protection needed for various terrains. Look for boots that are waterproof, breathable, and have a solid grip. The right pair should fit snugly but allow enough room for your toes to move freely, preventing blisters and discomfort.</p>

            <p>
            A quality backpack is essential for carrying your gear. Choose one with padded shoulder straps and a supportive back panel to distribute weight evenly. For day hikes, a 20-30 liter pack is usually sufficient. Look for a backpack with multiple compartments to organize your items and an integrated hydration system or space for a water bladder.

            <p>Dressing in layers is key to staying comfortable on the trail. Start with a moisture-wicking base layer, add an insulating layer like fleece or down for warmth, and finish with a waterproof and windproof outer layer. Avoid cotton, as it retains moisture and can lead to chafing and discomfort. Instead, opt for synthetic or wool materials that dry quickly.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Staying hydrated is critical on any hike. A durable water bottle or a hydration system like a CamelBak allows for easy access to water while on the move. Make sure to carry enough water for the duration of your hike, and consider bringing a portable water filter or purification tablets for longer trips.</p>

            <p>
            A map and compass are essential for navigating unfamiliar trails. Even if you have a GPS device or smartphone, always carry a physical map and know how to use a compass as a backup. These tools are crucial for staying on course, especially in remote areas with limited cell service.

            <p>
            Accidents can happen, so itâ€™s important to be prepared. A basic first aid kit should include bandages, antiseptic wipes, blister treatment, pain relievers, and any personal medications. Consider adding items like an emergency blanket and a small pair of scissors for more comprehensive coverage.

            <p>A multi-tool or knife is a versatile piece of gear that can assist with a variety of tasks, from preparing food to repairing equipment. Choose a compact, lightweight option with essential tools like a knife, scissors, and screwdriver. This tool can be a lifesaver in unexpected situations.</p>

            <p>
            A reliable light source is crucial, especially if your hike extends into the evening or takes place in low-light conditions. A headlamp is particularly useful because it frees up your hands. Make sure to pack extra batteries or a backup light just in case.
